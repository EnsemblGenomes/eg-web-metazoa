<h1>VectorBase annotation</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.vectorbase.org">VectorBase</a> has a stewardship role for many invertebrate genomes. 
The current VectorBase annotation strategy uses <a href="http://www.gmod.org/wiki/MAKER">MAKER</a> 
to combine <i>ab initio</i> predictions, protein similarity, and RNA-seq data. The resultant 
gene set is then improved by one or more rounds of community annotation. Further details, and 
information on earlier methods of annotation, are available in this <a href="https://www.vectorbase.org/tutorials/automatic-annotation-vectorbase">VectorBase tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>After community input, genome annotation is released to the public archives and mirrored in 
Ensembl Metazoa. Periodically, the annotation may be updated as new data or algorithms become 
available.</p>
