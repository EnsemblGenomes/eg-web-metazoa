<h1>WormBase ParaSite</h1>

<p>Parasitic worms (helminths) are responsible for more than a billion human infections globally 
and have a devastating impact on livestock and agriculture. As international efforts to sequence 
the genomes of parasitic helminths accelerate, Ensembl Genomes is collaborating with the 
Parasite Genomics Group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute on the provision of a new resource, 
<a title="WormBase ParaSite" href="http://parasite.wormbase.org">WormBase ParaSite</a>, to analyse, 
store and present information on these genomes. WormBase ParaSite uses Ensembl technology to store 
and provide access to genomic data, but is also closely integrated with and complementary to the main 
<a href="http://www.wormbase.org">WormBase</a> resource, the central focus of which is the model 
nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and its close relatives. WormBase ParaSite is funded by the 
<a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</a> (grant BB/K020080).</p>
