<h1>WormBase</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.wormbase.org">WormBase</a> is an international consortium of biologists and 
computer scientists dedicated to providing accurate, complete, accessible information concerning 
the genetics, genomics and biology of the model nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and selected 
other nematodes of medical and agricultural importance. The consortium comprises teams at four sites: 
the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR); 
the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI); and the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), 
where staff work as part of the Non-vertebrate Genomics team.  In order to maximise access to the 
genomic information it collates and curates, WormBase generates Ensembl formatted databases for 
inclusion in Ensembl and Ensembl Metazoa for a number of important nematode species.</p>

<p>WormBase is funded by the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/">National Human Genome Research Institute of the United States National Insitutes for Health</a> (grant #U41 HG002223), 
the UK <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index.htm">Medical Research Council</a> (grant MR/L001220), and the 
<a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</a> (grant BB/K020080)</p>
